<h1>Eternal love of RadhaKrishna</h1>
<p>Whenever we talk about Radha Krishna (we never say Radha without Krishna), who are just so darn in love with each other that both their names have combined into one.

Their true love and dedication have kept them alive in our hearts, their love story is hymned with praise for ages. </p>

<p> "True love has no end date. Coincidence and disconnection remain the same in both.‚Äù Isn't it so romantic? The promise of sharing eternity together, loving someone with your all, being there for someone, and having someone being there for you during high-lows. Yes, I know this kinda marvelous love, only true lovers like Radha-Krishna can share.</p>
